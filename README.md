# Deadliest Warrior
## Finding Out Who! Is! Deadliest!

Saw this online:

![Knight vs. monster](https://github.com/readyready15728/deadliest-warrior/blob/master/knight-vs-monster-puzzle.jpg)

Don't know whether there's a closed form. I suspect there might be, but I don't
know what it is. I do know Python though. Sample output of 100,000 runs:

```
Counter({'knight': 58466, 'monster': 40065, 'both dead': 1469})
```

Knight has the edge, but he's not exactly a safe bet.
